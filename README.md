# What it does

This tool provides support for you games of Arkham Horror 3rd Edition with some calculations.

- Track investigators' statuses and possessions.
- Keep an eye on monster level, number of portals, horror track, monster limit and all those little things you may forget during gameplay.
- Compare investigators to monsters and see how the encounter will play out.

# How it does it

A simple webserver provides a very basic page with all controls and knob for each connected player to adjust relevant investigators' stats.

# Disclaimer

This is an amatorial work, made by me and for me to be use as a support tool for live games of Arkham Horror 3rd edition with my friends, in a very specific circumstance.
Thus, I tried not to include any copyrighted content, and possession and use of the physical boardgame is required for playing.
I repeat: **you can not play Arkham Horror using only this tool, you need an actual physical copy of the game**.
